**The benchmarking relies upon:**

* a collection of individual studies. These are listed in the file `overall/data/study_metadata.csv`.
* a collection of metrics of concepts such as community stability and response diversity. These are listed in the file `overall/data/metrics_metadata.csv`

[The content and structure of the two datasets are described here.]((./docs/data_requirements.html))

**For each individual study:**

* Data must be carefully processed and arranged in a set of three or four datasets (traits, environment, composition, and community). [The content and structure of these datasets are described here.]((./docs/data_requirements.html)).

* The data in the three or four datasets must be processed to produce a single dataset containing information about the stability and response diversity of each community. [The content and structure of this datasets are described here.]((./docs/data_requirements.html)).
